# CodeSave
Chrome Extension to save code generated by ChatGPT as a file


# GitHub README

## Code Description

This code adds an "Create File" button to code containers on a webpage. When the button is clicked, it performs the following actions:

1. It clicks the "Copy Code" button in the code container.
2. It extracts the programming language of the code from the container.
3. It determines the appropriate file extension based on the language.
4. It reads the code from the clipboard.
5. It prompts the user to save the code as a file using the `showSaveFilePicker` API.
6. It writes the code to the selected file.

The code also includes a `MutationObserver` that listens for new code containers added to the page and automatically adds the "Create file" button to them. Additionally, there is a periodic check every 3 seconds to ensure that the button is added to all existing code containers.

## Usage

To use this code in your project, follow these steps:

1. Include the code in your JavaScript file or script tag.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary HTML elements on your webpage that represent code containers. These elements should have the following class: `flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md`.
3. Call the `addUpdateVscodeBtn` function for each existing code container to add the "Update" button manually.
4. Optionally, you can let the code automatically add the "Update" button to new code containers by including the `MutationObserver` and the periodic check.

> Note: The code relies on specific class names and DOM structure to identify and interact with code containers. Make sure your HTML structure matches the expected format.

## Supported Languages

The code currently supports the following programming languages and their respective file extensions:

- JavaScript: `.js`
- HTML: `.html`
- CSS: `.css`
- Python: `.py`
- Java: `.java`
- C#: `.cs`
- C++: `.cpp`
- Ruby: `.rb`
- Go: `.go`
- Swift: `.swift`
- SQL: `.sql`

> Note: You can add more cases to the `switch` statement in the code to support additional languages as needed.

## Limitations

- The code assumes that the "Copy code" button is present in the code container and has the class `flex ml-auto gap-2`. If the button has a different class or is not present, an error message will be logged.
- The code relies on the `showSaveFilePicker` API to prompt the user for file saving. This API is currently supported in modern browsers such as Chrome, Edge, and Firefox but may not work in all environments.
- The code uses the `MutationObserver` to listen for changes in the DOM and add the "Create File" button to new code containers. This may have performance implications if there are frequent additions or changes to the code containers on the page.
